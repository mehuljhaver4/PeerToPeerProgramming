# Peer To Peer Programming
 
### Brief Description:

* The P2P File Sharing System is a peer-to-peer file-sharing software that is similar to BitTorrent.
* The system was built using Java and Java Socket programming and implemented the choking-unchoking mechanism, which is one of BitTorrent's most important features.
* This system allows users to share files with each other without the need for a central server, leading to faster file transfers and reduced bandwidth usage.
